- **Sliding Window Technique:**
The Sliding Window technique is a common algorithmic approach used to optimize
problems that involve contiguous subarrays or substrings. The idea is to maintain 
a "window" of elements or characters that meets the desired condition and then slide it 
across the array or string.

- **Types of Sliding Window:**
There are two types of Sliding Window techniques: **Fixed Size Window** and **Variable/Dynamic Size Window.

- **Fixed Size Window:** In this type of window, the size of the window is fixed and
does not change during the sliding process. This type of window is used when the   
problem requires a fixed-size subarray or substring to be processed.

- **Variable/Dynamic Size Window:** The window expands and contracts depending on certain conditions, such as
 whether the sum exceeds a certain value or whether a condition is met.

 
 - **Time and Space Complexity:**
     Time Complexity ->  O(n)
     Space Complexity -> O(min(n, m)), where n is the size of the input array and m is the size of the window.
